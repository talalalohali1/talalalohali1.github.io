# Talal AlOhali Web

This is a personal portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a 3D "Antigravity" particle effect using Three.js.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML structure with content extracted from LinkedIn.
- `style.css`: Styling using a dark theme, glassmorphism, and animations.
- `script.js`: Logic for the Three.js particle background and scroll animations.

## How to Run Locally

1.  Open a terminal in this directory.
2.  Run a local server. For example, using Python:
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server 8080
    ```
    Or using Node.js (if installed):
    ```bash
    npx serve .
    ```
3.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

## Customization

-   **Content**: Edit `index.html` to update your bio, experience, or skills.
-   **Styles**: Modify `style.css` to change colors or animations.
-   **3D Effect**: Tweak `script.js` to adjust particle count, color, or movement behavior.
