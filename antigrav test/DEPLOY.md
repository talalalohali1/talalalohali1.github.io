# How to Make Your Website Live

Since this is a static website (HTML, CSS, JS), you have two excellent, free options to host it: **GitHub Pages** or **Vercel**.

## Option 1: Vercel (Easiest & Fastest)
Vercel is highly recommended for this type of portfolio. It's fast, free, and supports automatic deployments.

1.  **Create a GitHub Account** (if you don't have one).
2.  **Push your code to GitHub**:
    *   Create a new repository on GitHub.
    *   Upload your files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `logo.png`) to it.
3.  **Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com)** and sign up with GitHub.
4.  Click **"Add New..."** -> **"Project"**.
5.  Import your GitHub repository.
6.  Click **Deploy**.
    *   Vercel will give you a live URL (e.g., `talal-portfolio.vercel.app`) instantly.

## Option 2: GitHub Pages
Great if you want your URL to be `username.github.io`.

1.  Create a new repository on GitHub named `username.github.io` (replace `username` with your actual GitHub username).
2.  Push your code to this repository.
3.  Go to the repository **Settings** -> **Pages**.
4.  Under **Source**, select `main` branch and click **Save**.
5.  Your site will be live at `https://username.github.io`.

## Option 3: Drag & Drop (Netlify)
If you don't want to use Git:

1.  Go to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2.  Drag your entire project folder (`antigrav test`) into the browser window.
3.  Netlify will upload and host it instantly.
